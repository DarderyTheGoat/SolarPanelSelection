                <li>
                    <p>Here we used a for loop to seperate the table based on the value of the months (1-12) in the month column. doing this we will create 12 different tables each one containing a unique month value for each solar panel type and the unfiltered data.</p>

                    <p>Here we are getting the percentage of time a solar panel will work in a month. we do that by dividing each solar panel's table height (number of samples in which a solar panel can work) by the height of the unfiltered table (number of total samples). we do that for each month, as enviromental factors change by the month and arent consistent.</p>

                    <p>Here we created an array of total seconds in each month so we can multiply it by the percentage of time each solar panel would work each month to get active seconds for each solar panel in each month.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Here we are creating an array of tables for each solar panel except this time, the columns are constant and the value under them is the mean of the values in each month. these mean values will be used in the equations to determine energy production. we used the mean values in the filtered tables since these tables contain the values in which the solar panel will be active, meaning the other values wont be needed.</p>

In upcoming years, we wont account for the purchasing cost of the solar panels. Our deciision on which solar panel is best is only dependent on the data in the first year.</p>
